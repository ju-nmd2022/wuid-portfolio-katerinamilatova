          While studying at my grammar school, I got the chance to participate
          in a creation of a board game as an illustrator. To learn more about
          it, click on the picture.

        <h3>Poster</h3>
        <p>
          This poster was created during the admissions process at Aalto
          University. The assignment was to create a poster that expresses
          emotions and includes a photograph. I chose the theme of anorexia - a
          disease my friend was struggling with at the time.

        <h3>Figure sketches</h3>
        <p>
          I have always found that one of the hardest, but also most common
          things to be able to draw are figures. To practice this, I often chose
          dancers and tried to capture their bodies in motion.

        <h3>Enviromental sketches</h3>
        <p>
          But most of all I like to sit somewhere in the city with my sketchbook
          and draw things around me. Mostly architecture, but sometimes also
          people and details. Most of the pictures posted here were drawn during
          my trip to Prague.
